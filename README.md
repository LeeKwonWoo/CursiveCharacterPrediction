# CursiveCharacterPrediction

This project aim to implements cursive character prediction in android app. The input image which insert to the system will be preprocess and analyzed then the prediction result will be given us output. Convolutional neural network (DenseNet-201) was used to classify the different cursive characters images. The model was therefore, extended to a mobile application.
